  "Our hackathon is a 40 hour event where teams collaborate on a project to create social impact, satisfy company challenges, and innovate new solutions. At RowdyHacks, mentors will be willing to assist you on your quest to creating your project.",
  "RowdyHacks is absolutely FREE thanks to our awesome partners. You don't have to worry about a thing -- we'll provide t-shirts, swag, and prizes.",
  "No worries! RowdyHacks is for everyone from all coding and non-coding backgrounds! We will have plenty of mentors and workshops to help you learn throughout the event.",
  "Teams can consist of up to 4 students! We encourage hackers to participate as part of a team. Don't have a team? No worries, we will have an opportunity before the event for you to meet other hackers and form teams!",
  "Anything! You can make a new social media website, a simple weather app, a sentimental analysis tool for tweets...anything in your wildest imagination, you can create. Your team can come prepared with an idea or come up with one on the spot.",
  "No, all projects must be built from scratch. However, you can start brainstorming your ideas prior to the event. Any team found working on previous projects will be automatically disqualified.",
  "No problem! RowdyHacks is open to ANY college/university student over 18 years old. We're so excited to see students from all over collaborating and innovating together at this year's event.",
  "Any hardware you plan on using for the project -- your laptop, charger, portable mouse, phone, Raspberry Pi, VR headset, robots, etc. Don't forget to keep water and snacks on hand!",
  "RowdyHacks VI will be virtual and hosted through WHOVA! Keep up to date through our social medias and our mailing list.",
  "Unfortunately, even if you attend two virtual hackathons on the same weekend, you can't submit the same project to both hackathons.",
  "RowdyHacks VI will last 40 hours. We wanted to extend RowdyHacks this year to give hackers some extra time to hack and squeeze in some quality sleep.",
  "Hackers can submit their projects to either the Learners Track (geared towards those who are in intro CS classes or those who haven't coded before) or the General Track (for those with moderate to advanced skills). In addition to submitting projects to a track, hackers can also submit their project for cybersecurity, hardware, or sponsor prizes.",
  "RowdyHacks is completely free to attend and open to any university or college student over 18 years of age. We also welcome recent grads! If you've graduated in the past year, you're also eligible to attend!",
